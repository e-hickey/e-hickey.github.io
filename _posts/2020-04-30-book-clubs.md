<p> One of the more challenging things that I've had to think about 
in regards to working from home is how to hold a book club meeting. 
I have been in charge of a book club (of about 10 or so amazing regulars) 
for about 3 years now. We have been working on how to engage, as even 
after we open back up, we will not be able to have meetings for the 
for-seeable future in order to respect social distancing. </p>

<p> There are several possibilities that we are looking into. 
One is having virtual meetings over Zoom or a similar video 
conferencing program. I imagine that this will happen rather soon, as 
my regulars seemed enthusiastic about engaging like this. I would also 
like to offer something like discussion forums for those unable to make 
meetings, but would still like to participate. It seems that using our 
system's Goodreads page will work well for that, as it allows us to create 
discussion threads and then interact and monitor them. Certainly a lot to think 
about! </p>
