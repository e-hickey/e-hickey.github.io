<p> At the point of the post, we are well past a month of stay-at-home orders
due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which means that I have been working from home for more 
than a month. It's beenan interesting mix of relaxing and nerve-wracking. I am 
extremely fortunate to still have a job, of course. I know that that's not the case 
for a lot of people, so I am extremely grateful to my county for continuing to 
employ us during this time. While it took us all a while to get our footing, we've 
recently hit our stride, I think.</p>

<p> That image is part of something that I and a coworker were tasked with organizing.
Our entire reference department got together and put together a large amount of 
resources for our patrons. My coworker and I then compiled them and formatted them to 
work on our <a href="http://library.booksite.com/7309/nl/?list=CNL1&group=EB56">website</a>.
Hopefully we continue to produce good resources and information for our patrons
going forward. </p>
