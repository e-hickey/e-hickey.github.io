<p>Hello, my name is Ethan Hickey, and I am currently an MLIS candidate at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.I have been working professionally in the library industry for six years, and I currently work for a public library system on the reference desk. I have an undergraduate degree in Biology, and would like to work in the medical or health sciences librarianship field. As such, this website will contain posts and thoughts about modern librarianship, with a science slant.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
